# CPU Simulator

The CPU Simulator demonstrates the inner workings of a CPU by processing the following short list of simplified instructions:

```
CACHE,1
ADDI,R2,R2,2
ADD,R3,R2,R1
J,8
HALT,;
```

## Features

The CPU Simulator was built for demonstration purposes only and focuses on a very small portion of the CPU's and ALU's capabilities. It showcases the CPU's fetch-decode-execute cycle and processes the given commands. It will not be possible to give any other instructions to the CPU Simulator than the ones provided.


## Usage

To see the CPU Simulator in action fork and clone the repository, make sure you have a suitable Python version (e.g. 3.11.5) installed on your machine and run the file simulation.py in your terminal.


## Contribution

If you would like to take the CPU Simulator to the next level and add functionality, pull requests are welcome.

## About

This is the final project for module 4 "Computer Architecture" of the "Computer Science" Career Path on codecademy.com, created by Peafly_78. The CPU simulator has been created using Python 3.11.5.
